# PCI Open Access Database Evaluatory Tool
Experimental Github Open Access Database Repository.

# Purpose
* A way to build collaboration into a project that relies on collaboration.
** A way to use GitHub Pages as a way of showing librarians the benefit of Git. (Problem, Librarians often want to publish info but don't useful outlets). 

# Data
